                the university, even if I don’t feel the need of purchasing few books but still I would have to

                purchase all of them if I want any. So, this semester I decided to sell all my old books and

                <p>This is my sixth semester and for the last five semesters I have been purchasing books from

                the university, even if I don’t feel the need of purchasing few books but still I would have to

                purchase all of them if I want any. So, this semester I decided to sell all my old books and

                purchase some second-hand books from the book market which I desire.

                 How was your experience of selling books to the shopkeepers and at Nayi Sadak, New Delhi?

                I went to Nayi Sadak on a Sunday morning with few of my friends. It was very congested. The

                shops were on the either side of the roads, roads being 6-7 feet wide complimented by

                some road side shopkeepers keeping their stalls by the side of the road and vehicles parked

                in front of store which made it more congested, so, carrying books in that market was

                literally a headache who is not familiar with that market. Selling books there was not an easy

                task neither purchasing the books which we want, the main issues being cost. First of all, the

                shopkeepers were not willing to pay the genuine price of the books (they rated around 10-

                15% of the original cost) for all the books. So, we had to roam here and there with that

                heavy luggage to find appropriate rates, we found a shop after roaming around and hour

                (22% which is still below the rates seeing the conditions and edition of the books) but we

                were feeling tired of carrying that luggage so we laid down our weapon.</p>

                 <p class="flow-text">3. Tell us your experience of selling the books.</p>
                <p>
                  Our task was not yet over. When we went on to purchase books we came to know that it is

                  rather an impossible task to purchase than selling. We literally roamed and visited entire

                  market, not a single seller had all the books, and even not the entire market had few of the

                  books which we desired. We were 8 students and we got subject books of only 3 subjects

                  that too not all of us. On top of that they sensed that we need those books, so, those who

                  had it were pricing it very high. The market price of book is 432 Rs and they were asking for

                  about 350 for the older edition.</p>
                  <p class="flow-text">4. What did you learn or how would you summarize your experience of doing business of old

                  semester course books at Nayi Sadak, New Delhi?</p>
                  <p>  So, from my experience I determined one thing that whatever may happen in the future, I

                    am not going to sell any of my books over there, I would rather let it be in my room, and

                    neither I am going to buy any books from Old book stores, I will manage somehow because

                    it is not worth it. First going to Delhi from here by changing bus, then metro, etc. costing

                    about 200rs on that trip only, after that the torture of selling and purchasing,</p>

              <p class="flow-text">1. How was your experience of going from such a remote location to Delhi for buying/selling the

books?</p>

  <p>In my opinion selling/buying book at Nayi Sadak Market is really a very tough task. A week

  ago, I went to sell my 10 core subject books at Nayi Sadak Market. Firstly Nayi Sadak Market

  is around 2.5 hours away from our university and that is only possible when there is no

  traffic, so going there along with the a bag full of books was a hectic task as well as laborious

  task.</p>

   <p class="flow-text">2. How was your experience with the shopkeepers at Nayi Sadak, New Delhi?</p>

  <p>You will see and meet the real Delhi people when you start approaching to shops in order to

  sell your books because initially they show us like they are not interested to buy books by

  offering a least amount and they offered me 600 Rs only for 10 books Can you believe it?

  And there are so many shopkeepers which tell you the almost same price. So after visiting

  several book store we finally got a store which was giving us a decent amount compared to

  others in return of our books. </p>

   <p class="flow-text">3. What were expectation and for how much did you sell?</p>
  <p>I sold my 10 core subjects books which consists mainly of 5 th  and 4 th  semester books in

  exchange of Rs 1300 where as I was expecting around Rs 2000 at least because I paid

  somewhere around Rs 6000 to Rs 7000 for those 10 books. So expecting around 33% which

  is quite reasonable in my opinion but what I had receive is just Rs 1300 which is around 20%

  of the total cost of the books. I was initially offered Rs 1100 for my 10 books from the

  shopkeeper but after a negotiating for around more than 25 minutes he came to Rs 1300, as

  it wouldn’t be feasible for me to take back my books back to university so I finally accepted

  the deal at Rs 1300.</p>
  <p class="flow-text">4. Does buying is as difficult as selling of books at Nayi Sadak, New Delhi?</p>

  <p>After selling we moved to buying books for the 6 th  semester. So you will not find all the

  books at one store if you are looking for the 2 nd  hand books. You need to roam around shop

  to shop for finding the appropriate shop and getting the correct book. Now comes the

  pricing of the 2 nd  hand books. Again it’s up to you how much you can bargain for each book.

  For example I was getting a 2 nd  hand refrigeration and air conditioning book at a   price of Rs

  350 and the same book on amazon was of Rs 400. So you can get slightly cheaper books than

  the brand new ones but for that you need to spend your time and you need to have good

  negotiation skills else you will end up having nothing.</p>

   <p class="flow-text">5. So, how can you summarize your whole day, from university to Nayi Sadak and then coming

  back to the university?</p>

<p>  So, going there along with bag full of books and finding the appropriate shop and coming

  back was like almost a day or more than this. Apart from this the transport cost was

  somewhere around Rs 150 and you also need to eat something as you are away from your

  university for whole day. So going there and selling books was a very laborious task and

  apart from this not getting the appropriate price was like coming back with empty hands .</p>
