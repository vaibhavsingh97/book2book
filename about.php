                <p class="flow-text">How many times have you taken that journey to the bookstore, lazily, wishing that those books could end up at your doorstep? Do you have books that you no longer need? Books that you either intend to throw or recycle away?</p>
                <p class="flow-text"> Books are amongst the basic necessities. Whether you're in school, or college or even office - you still need them. And now second-hand books are just a couple of clicks away!</p>
                <p class="flow-text">Book2Book offers you to sell or buy any of your old semester course books from anywhere
                and anytime by being a seller or a buyer respectively through its online portal <a href="index.php">www.Book2Book.hol.es</a></p>
